## Objectives:
This project intends to serve as a repository of knowledge, for Pitt students and others, on topics that may not be explored thoroughly through regular classwork. All tutorials for this project were created altruistically by HKN members at the University of Pittsburgh hoping to share their experience with others. Topics covered range from class-specific aid - to specific knowledge about common components.
